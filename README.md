# Introduction

This repository holds examples of how to use the [Actix-Web](https://actix.rs/) web framework. For example:

- Serving a React App
- Providing REST APIs, including scope (e.g. `/v1/create-resource`, `/v2/list-resources`)
- Providing a GraphQL endpoint
- Providing a WebSocket endpoint (I copied exactly this from the example in the docs)

The `route-testing.http` file provides example API calls that you can click on to test the API routes, if you are using VS Code and the [REST Client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) extension.
